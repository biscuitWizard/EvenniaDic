        The cerata use siloxane backbones (alternating silicon-oxygen chains), as siloxanes can form a wide variety of 
        polymers. They respire fluorine gas. As such, the cerata are prone 
        to exploding on contact with an Earth-like atmosphere.
        
        Features four stalk-like digitigrade legs ending in three opposed silica-based talons each, and two arms
        ending in hands with segmented palms, three fingers, and two thumb-like appendages. They are capable of 
        communicating with nearby cerata using high-bandwidth gamma-ray wavelength color-pulse signaling.
        
        Their ships commonly do not use any cooling at all, and most cerata find peak comfort at about 150C.
        At about 50C, cerata enter a type of hibernation state where after a few hours they will die
        from hypothermia.
        
        Ceratans can molt to a needed gender. Nymphs hatch from eggs are determinedly
        male or sexless from a gyne. Nymphs are basic workers and often not very independent or far from a gyne.
        Eventually a nymph can molt to either an alate (a male with wings), or a gyne (reproductive female).
        
        It is not unheard of to see an alate alone, but gynes will always have a swarm of alates, or nymphs nearby.
        Gynes do not operate in similar territories, being very proud and very territorial. There will almost never
        be more than one gyne on a ceratan ship. This reproductive strategy has made ceratan prolific in space.
        
        Ceratans are on par technologically with humans despite having achieved space-flight earlier. All cerata
        seen off world or on human stations will be wearing an exo-suit that keeps them warm and not-exploded.
        
        Ceratan fluids and organs are highly organofluoridic.
